# Now let’s define the necessary setup files we will be using for data

#
# The :class:`~nm_stream_abc` can either be created as a *.tsv* text file, or as a pandas
# DataFrame. There are some helper functions that let you create the
# nm_channels without much effort:

nm_channels = nm.utils.get_default_channels_from_data(data, car_rereferencing=True)

nm_channels

# %%
# Using this function default channel names and a common average re-referencing scheme is specified.
# Alternatively the *define_nmchannels.set_channels* function can be used to pass each column values.
#
# nm_settings
# -----------
# Next, we will initialize the nm_settings dictionary and use the default settings, reset them, and enable a subset of features:

settings = nm.NMSettings.get_fast_compute()


# %%
# The setting itself is a .json file which contains the parametrization for preprocessing, feature estimation, postprocessing and
# definition with which sampling rate features are being calculated.
# In this example `sampling_rate_features_hz` is specified to be 10 Hz, so every 100ms a new set of features is calculated.
#
# For many features the `segment_length_features_ms` specifies the time dimension of the raw signal being used for feature calculation. Here it is specified to be 1000 ms.
#
# We will now enable the features:
#
# * fft
# * bursts
# * sharpwave
#
# and stay with the default preprcessing methods:
#
# * notch_filter
# * re_referencing
#
# and use *z-score* postprocessing normalization.

settings.features.fooof = True
settings.features.fft = True
settings.features.bursts = True
settings.features.sharpwave_analysis = True

# %%
# We are now ready to go to instantiate the *Stream* and call the *run* method for feature estimation:

stream = nm.Stream(
    settings=settings,
    channels=nm_channels,
    verbose=True,
    sfreq=sfreq,
    line_noise=50,
)

features = stream.run(data, save_csv=True)

# %%
# Feature Analysis
# ----------------
#
# There is a lot of output, which we could omit by verbose being False, but let's have a look what was being computed.
# We will therefore use the :class:`~nm_analysis` class to showcase some functions. For multi-run -or subject analysis we will pass here the feature_file "sub" as default directory:

analyzer = nm.FeatureReader(
    feature_dir=stream.out_dir_root, feature_file=stream.experiment_name
)

# %%
# Let's have a look at the resulting "feature_arr" DataFrame:

analyzer.feature_arr.iloc[:10, :7]

# %%
# Seems like a lot of features were calculated. The `time` column tells us about each row time index.
# For the 6 specified channels, it is each 31 features.
# We can now use some in-built plotting functions for visualization.
#
# .. note::
#
#     Due to the nature of simulated data, some of the features have constant values, which are not displayed through the image normalization.
#
#

analyzer.plot_all_features(ch_used="ch1")

# %%
nm.analysis.plot_corr_matrix(
    figsize=(25, 25),
    show_plot=True,
    feature=analyzer.feature_arr,
)

# %%
# The upper correlation matrix shows the correlation of every feature of every channel to every other.
# This notebook demonstrated a first demo how features can quickly be generated. For further feature modalities and decoding applications check out the next notebooks.
