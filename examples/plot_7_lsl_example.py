"""
Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) Example
=================================

This toolbox implements the lsl ecosystem which can be utilized for offline use cases as well as live streamings
In this example the data introduced in the first demo is being analyzed
in a similar manner, This time however integrating an lsl stream.

# Playing the Data
# ----------------

# Now we need our data to be represeted in the LSL stream.
# For this example an mne_lsl.Player is utilized, which is playing our earlier
# recorded data. However, you could make use of any LSL source (live or
# offline).
# If you want to bind your own data source, make sure to specify the
# necessary parameters (data type, type, name) accordingly.
# If you are unsure about the parameters of your data source you can
# always search for available lsl streams.

# -----------------------------
