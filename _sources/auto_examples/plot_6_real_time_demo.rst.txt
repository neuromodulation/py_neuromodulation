Real-time feature estimation
============================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 8-46

Implementation of individual nm_streams
---------------------------------------

*py_neuromodulation* was optimized for computation of real-time data streams.
There are however center -and lab specific hardware acquisition systems. Therefore, each experiment requires modules to interact with hardware platforms
which periodically acquire data.

Given the raw data, data can be analyzed using *py_neuromodulation*. Preprocessing methods, such as re-referencing and normalization,
feature computation and decoding can be performed then in real-time.

For online as well as as offline analysis, the :class:`~nm_stream_abc` class needs to be instantiated.
Here the `nm_settings` and `channels` are required to be defined.
Previously for the offline analysis, an offline :class:`~nm_generator` object was defined that periodically yielded data.
For online data, the :meth:`~stream_abc.run` function therefore needs to be overwritten, which first acquires data and then calls
the :meth:`~run_analysis.process` function.

The following illustrates in pseudo-code how such a stream could be initialized:

.. code-block:: python

   from py_neuromodulation import nm_stream_abc

   class MyStream(nm_stream_abc):
   def __init__(self, settings, channels):
       super().__init__(settings, channels)

   def run(self):
      features_ = []
       while True:
          data = self.acquire_data()
          features_.append(self.run_analysis.process(data))
          # potentially use machine learning model for decoding


Computation time examples
-------------------------

The following example calculates for six channels, CAR re-referencing, z-score normalization and FFT features results the following computation time:

Those results show that the computation time for a typical pipeline (FFT, re-referencing, notch-filtering, feature normalization)
is well below 10 ms, which is fast enough for real-time analysis with feature sampling rates below 100 Hz.
Computation of more complex features could still result in feature sampling rates of more than 30 Hz.

Real-time movement decoding using the TMSi-SAGA amplifier
---------------------------------------------------------

In the following example, we will show how we setup a real-time movement decoding experiment using the TMSi-SAGA amplifier.
First, we relied on different software modules for data streaming and visualization.
`LabStreamingLayer <https://labstreaminglayer.org>`_ allows for real-time data streaming and synchronization across multiple devices.
We used `timeflux <https://timeflux.io>`_ for real-time data visualization of features, decoded output.
For raw data visualization we used `Brain Streaming Layer <https://fcbg-hnp-meeg.github.io/bsl/dev/index.html>`_.

The code for real-time movement decoding is added in the GitHub branch `realtime_decoding <https://github.com/neuromodulation/py_neuromodulation/tree/realtime_decoding>`_.
Here we relied on the `TMSI SAGA Python interface <https://gitlab.com/tmsi/tmsi-python-interface>`_.
