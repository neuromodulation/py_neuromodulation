Now let’s define the necessary setup files we will be using for data
preprocessing and feature estimation. Py_neuromodualtion is based on two
parametrization files: the *channels.tsv* and the *default_settings.json*.

The :class:`~nm_stream_abc` can either be created as a *.tsv* text file, or as a pandas
DataFrame. There are some helper functions that let you create the
nm_channels without much effort:

Using this function default channel names and a common average re-referencing scheme is specified.
Alternatively the *define_nmchannels.set_channels* function can be used to pass each column values.

nm_settings
-----------
Next, we will initialize the nm_settings dictionary and use the default settings, reset them, and enable a subset of features:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 105-109

.. code-block:: Python


    settings = nm.NMSettings.get_fast_compute()









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 110-128

The setting itself is a .json file which contains the parametrization for preprocessing, feature estimation, postprocessing and
definition with which sampling rate features are being calculated.
In this example `sampling_rate_features_hz` is specified to be 10 Hz, so every 100ms a new set of features is calculated.

For many features the `segment_length_features_ms` specifies the time dimension of the raw signal being used for feature calculation. Here it is specified to be 1000 ms.

We will now enable the features:

* fft
* bursts
* sharpwave

and stay with the default preprcessing methods:

* notch_filter
* re_referencing

and use *z-score* postprocessing normalization.

    settings.features.fft = True
    settings.features.bursts = True

We are now ready to go to instantiate the *Stream* and call the *run* method for feature estimation:

Feature Analysis
----------------

There is a lot of output, which we could omit by verbose being False, but let's have a look what was being computed.
We will therefore use the :class:`~nm_analysis` class to showcase some functions. For multi-run -or subject analysis we will pass here the feature_file "sub" as default directory:

Seems like a lot of features were calculated. The `time` column tells us about each row time index.
For the 6 specified channels, it is each 31 features.
We can now use some in-built plotting functions for visualization.

.. note::

    Due to the nature of simulated data, some of the features have constant values, which are not displayed through the image normalization.

This notebook demonstrated a first demo how features can quickly be generated. For further feature modalities and decoding applications check out the next notebooks.
